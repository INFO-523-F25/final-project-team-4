    "text": "The overall goal of our project is to generate an interactive dashboard that displays information about air quality in the United States over the past year. Ideally, this dashboard could serve as a tool for people to better understand the factors influencing air quality both in their area and across the United States more broadly. We are aiming to have visualizations for each of the major air pollutants in addition to an overall graph of the AQI over time. Further visualizations could include a rendering of the AQI scale showing the range from good to hazardous, a graph of the top 10 counties with the worst air quality on average, or another similar visual displaying patterns or outliers in our data. The dashboard will include filters for time period, season, and geographic region. During the EDA phase of our project, we may also choose to enrich the data further with population density by county or other key features that may provide further context to the dashboard. Our dashboard will be one page to ensure data can be easily compared and it is as intuitive to use as possible.\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd"

    "text": "Dataset\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('./data/daily_aqi_by_county_2025.csv')\nprint(data.shape)\n\n(105869, 10)\n\n\nWe decided to use the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2025 daily Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset by county. It contains 105,869 rows with 10 variables showing insight into daily air quality and how it changes over days, months, and seasons. The dataset comes from collections of air quality measurements by specific monitoring stations over the year. Key variables include the location of the measurement, the AQI value (standardized value representing the pollution level), and the air quality category (qualitative variable representing how poor or great the air quality is on a scale).\nThis dataset was ideal for our goal to create an interactive dashboard portraying visual patterns and trends with air quality in different regions and seasons over time. Additionally, it will allow for further discovery into the differences in air quality over weeks, months and the whole year. Furthermore, being able to create a dashboard with real environmental implications was important as we would be able to visualize how pollution has affected certain regions over the last year. Using daily data with several data points will also allow us to create a more accurate representation of pollution and air quality in different regions and seasons over 2025. Ultimately, the EPA’s daily AQI index dataset was ideal for portraying air quality in an interactive dashboard through data driven visualization.\nVariables: State Name: US State County Name: US County Name State Code: Code for State County Code: Code for County Date: date of measurement AQI: Air Quality Index value Category: Qualitative value for AQI Defining Paramter: AQS code corresponding to the parameter measured Defining Site: Site corresponding to the site where measurement was reported from Number of Sites Reporting: Total amount of sites with recording measurement"

    "text": "Analysis plan\nWeek 1 - EDA / Preprocessing\nThis week should be focused on understanding the data and any interesting relationships between the features and the target variable (AQI value). Next, using the findings from the EDA stage, the focus should be handling any data quality issues (missing value, encoding categorical variables, scaling values) and removing any unnecessary columns. By the end of this week, we should have a summary of key findings from the EDA and a preprocessed dataset.\nWeek 2 - Modeling\nThis week should be focused on performing advanced modeling techniques, such as OLS and other regression models to understand the importance of the features and rank the influence that the features have on the target variable. By the end of this week, we should have a list of features that contribute to the Air Quality Index.\nWeek 3 - Dashboard Wireframing\nThis week should be focused on designing and mapping out the metrics to use on the interactive dashboard. This should include the type of visuals, the expected interactions of variables and require data structures to build the report. By the end of this week, we should have a rough sketch of the dashboard that answers the questions above.\nWeek 4 - Dashboard Building\nThis week should be focused on implementing wireframed dashboards using the Stream-lit library. This should include the building, testing, and finding key interactions between the visuals to demonstrate during the final presentation. By the end of this week, we should have a deployed dashboard with 2-3 patterns identified by the dashboard.\nWeek 5 - Final Report\nThis week should be focused on completing the final write-up and presentation. The group members for each week should discuss their decision about the work they were responsible for. By the end of the week, we should have a finalized report and recorded video."
